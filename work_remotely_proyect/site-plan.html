      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I plan to create a website dedicated to assisting women who are transitioning from in-person
          work to remote work, particularly focusing on church members. This platform will feature a
          combination of my personal experiences, valuable tips, engaging activities, recommended
          training resources, and relevant scriptures. One section of the website will be dedicated to
          sharing my own journey, while another will offer practical guidance on making this transition
          successfully.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h4> Introduction</h4>

      <h4>My story</h4>
        
      <p>Before the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded, I found myself spending eight hours a day working 
        in a government office while a nanny cared for my young son.
        When the Covid-related isolation measures were implemented,
        I was compelled to work from home, leading me to discover the sheer beauty of being able to work
        while watching my son play and grow. This experience sparked a decision within me to acquire the 
        necessary education to pursue remote job opportunities. 
        It wasn't an easy journey; it demanded strength and unwavering perseverance, 
        which I found in the teachings of the Gospel of Christ and the invaluable guidance of the Holy Spirit.
        And here I am, three years later, cherishing the moments of raising my son 
        while working from the comfort of home.
         I hope my experience can inspire and resonate with other women seeking remote work opportunities.</p>
