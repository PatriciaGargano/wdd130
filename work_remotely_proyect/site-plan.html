          training resources, and relevant scriptures. One section of the website will be dedicated to
          sharing my own journey, while another will offer practical guidance on making this transition
          successfully.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>My story</h4>
        
      <p>Before the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded, I found myself spending eight hours a day working 
        in a government office while a nanny cared for my young son.
        When the Covid-related isolation measures were implemented,
        I was compelled to work from home, leading me to discover the sheer beauty of being able to work
        while watching my son play and grow. This experience sparked a decision within me to acquire the 
        necessary education to pursue remote job opportunities. 
        It wasn't an easy journey; it demanded strength and unwavering perseverance, 
        which I found in the teachings of the Gospel of Christ and the invaluable guidance of the Holy Spirit.
        And here I am, three years later, cherishing the moments of raising my son 
        while working from the comfort of home.
         I hope my experience can inspire and resonate with other women seeking remote work opportunities.</p>

      The inclusion of these materials goes beyond conventional academics, 
      creating a learning environment that is not only intellectually stimulating but also motivational on a spiritual level.
    
      <h3>Online courses</h3>

      LinkedIn provides a wide array of courses,
      both free and paid,covering diverse subjects, accessible to users who have a profile on the platform.
      Diverse platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and edX also provide courses catering to high-demand fields, 
      allowing students to learn at their own pace according to their schedules.
      These platforms host a variety of courses covering subjects that are in high demand in the labor market,
      offering flexibility to accommodate each student's availability. 
      <h4>Linkedin</h4>
      Within its expansive ecosystem, LinkedIn offers a diverse array of courses covering a broad spectrum of subjects.
       This educational facet is not only accessible but also versatile, with both free and paid options, 
       making it an inclusive platform for users with varying budgetary considerations. 
       The caveat for entry into this digital academy is simple: possession of a user profile on the platform.
        This requirement, in turn, makes the wealth of knowledge housed within LinkedIn Learning available to a vast
         audience.

      <h4>Other digital platforms</h4>
      Beyond LinkedIn, the online education landscape is enriched by three main platforms: Coursera, Udemy, and edX. These platforms have carved their niches in the digital educational sphere, offering courses that cater to the burgeoning demand in high-demand fields. The beauty of these platforms lies in their commitment to providing learners with the flexibility to chart their own educational trajectories.

      <h3>Tips&Contact</h3>
      <p>
        Transitioning to remote work or even changing careers to facilitate working from home can be challenging. Here are some tips to achieve this: have faith in your potential, trust in the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and continuously nurture your spiritual well-being to face new challenges. Be persistent. 
        You'll experience good and tough days, but keep moving forward. 
        Your well-being and that of your family are worth it!
        In my professional journey, even during challenging times, I've found that progressing in the pursuit of a career change is indeed possible. Here are some valuable tips tailored to the unique experiences of women with children:
      <h4>1. Cultivate Spiritual Guidance:</h4>
        In moments of uncertainty, turning to prayer can provide solace and guidance. Trusting in the wisdom of the Holy Spirit can offer a source of strength and direction as you navigate the difficulties  of your career transition.
      <h4>2. Embrace Patience:</h4>
        Balancing the demands of daily life with the aspirations for a new career can be daunting. On those particularly challenging days, remind yourself to be patient. Keep your ultimate goal in focus, understanding that better days will come, and each step forward, no matter how small, contributes to your progress.
      <h4>3. Craft a Family-Centric Career Plan:</h4>
        Incorporate your role as a mother into your career plan. Establishing both short-term and long-term goals that align with your family's needs allows for better time management and a clearer path forward. Consider flexible options that accommodate your responsibilities at home.
      <h4>4. Build a Support System:</h4>
        Recognize the strength in seeking support from friends, family, or any allies in your network. Discussing your ambitions and challenges with others can provide valuable insights, encouragement, and sometimes even practical assistance. A strong support system is particularly crucial for women juggling both professional and familial responsibilities.
      <h4>5. Cultivate Persistence:</h4>
        The journey toward a new career is a marathon, not a sprint. Persistence is key. Consistency in your efforts, even when faced with setbacks, will propel you forward. Understand that achievements unfold over time, and steadfast dedication is essential to overcoming obstacles.
      <h4>6. Optimize Your Online Presence:</h4>
        In today's digital age, enhancing your profile on job search platforms is a strategic move. Highlight your skills, experiences, and achievements, ensuring that your online presence effectively communicates your professional narrative. Tailor your profile to showcase how your unique skills and background bring value to potential employers.
      <h4>7. Foster Self-Confidence:</h4>
        Believe in yourself and the significance of your career aspirations. Recognize that as a woman with children, you possess a wealth of skills, resilience, and adaptability gained through your multifaceted role. Trust in your abilities and the importance of the reasons driving your career change.
        In conclusion, navigating a career change as a woman with children involves a blend of spiritual guidance, patience, strategic planning, a strong support system, persistence, and a well-crafted online presence. By weaving these elements into your journey, you can not only overcome the challenges but also emerge stronger and more empowered in your professional pursuits. Remember, you have the capacity to shape a fulfilling career that aligns with your values and accommodates your role as a devoted mother.
