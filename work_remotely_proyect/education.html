                <p>Various educational resources can be found on the web, encompassing both free and paid options. 
                    Among these, Brigham Young University, backed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
                    ranks within the top 5000 universities globally, offering both in-person and online training at varying costs based on student specifications. 
                    Deciding which educational path to take to obtain a remote job can be challenging. The choice of online and onsite courses, careers, and specializations can be overwhelming. 
                    To do this, the first thing to consider is what skills you possess and which ones you would like to apply to a remote job. There are many opportunities in various fields; 
                    among the most requested options are the technology field, community management, digital marketing, and project management. Here are some available resources.</p>

                    <h2>University</h2>
                    <p>Before the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded, I found myself spending eight hours a day working in a government office while a nanny cared for my young son.
                       When the Covid-related isolation measures were implemented, I was compelled to work from home, leading me to discover the sheer beauty of being able to work while watching my son play and grow. 
                       This experience sparked a decision within me to acquire the necessary education to pursue remote job opportunities. It wasn't an easy journey; it demanded strength and unwavering perseverance, which I found in the teachings of the Gospel of Christ and the invaluable guidance of the Holy Spirit. And here I am, three years later, cherishing the moments of raising my son while working from the comfort of home. 
                       I hope my experience can inspire and resonate with other women seeking remote work opportunities</p>
